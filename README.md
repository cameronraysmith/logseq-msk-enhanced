## Logseq - Enhanced Dark & Light Theme

### Theme Features

- An enhanced version of the default Logseq theme (focus on dark mode; light mode is also available but not fully done)
- Highlight current block path (via [colorful indents](https://github.com/cannibalox/logseq-dark-hpx))
- Easier identifiable headings
- Identify external/page links (via `*` and `^`)
- More beautiful task labels, priorities and tags
- Easier to identify list item numbers
